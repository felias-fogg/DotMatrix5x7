Version 1.5.0 (29.5.2023)
TIMER0 is now the default interrupt source. Added a default parameter to the
begin method for selecting the appropriate timer interrupt. In order
to avoid TIMER0_CMPA interrupt conflicts, one needs to set the compile
time constant USETIMER0 in DotMatrix5x7.h to 0. If one wants to use
TIMER1, one needs to define USETIMER1 to 1. Only if both compile time
constants are set to 1, then the timer parameter for the begin method is significant.

Version 1.4.4
Corrected code for sZET in font file (it is now truly 0xE1)
Added comment for adding new symbols
Added GitHub actions and badges
Made example idleFunction compatible with offical Low-Power lib
Added code in DotMatrix5x7.cpp to use other timing constants and ISRs
when USETIMER0 is defined

New methods: sleep() and wakeup(), which shut down the display, respectively, wakes it up again
New method: setFont() without arguments restores original font
Scrolling is now flicker free
